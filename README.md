<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

# What is Nuvents?

<i>Nuvents</i> (n.) is a portmanteaut of the words "New" and "Events". As we are social beings, events are a way to bring people together and connect with one another.

This app is a way for friends and organizations to create events and have people come together to socialize. 

<br />

# Inspiration

The idea of this app came from the way we have evolved at such unprecedented times. Events can range from physical to virtual. Now these days, events do not necessarily need to be only face-to-face and we have the necessary tools to flexibly make events happen in different formats.

# How We Built It

This project was conceptualized by building wireframes and prototypes using Figma. We then built our project over 2 weeks. We used React and Redux, and Tailwind CSS.
